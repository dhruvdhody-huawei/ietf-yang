    <abstract>
    <t>This document defines a YANG data model for the management of
    Path Computation Element communications Protocol (PCEP) for
    communications between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a Path
    Computation Element (PCE), or between two PCEs. The data model
    includes configuration and state data.</t>

    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
    <t>The Path Computation Element (PCE) defined in <xref target="RFC4655"/>
    is an entity that is capable of computing a network path or route
    based on a network graph, and applying computational constraints.
    A Path Computation Client (PCC) may make requests to a PCE for paths
    to be computed.</t>

   <t>PCEP is the communication protocol between a PCC and PCE and is
   defined in <xref target="RFC5440"/>. PCEP interactions include path
   computation requests and path computation replies as well as
   notifications of specific states related to the use of a PCE in the
   context of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS
   (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE). <xref target='RFC8231'/>
   specifies extensions to PCEP to enable stateful control of MPLS TE LSPs. </t>

   <t>This document defines a YANG <xref target="RFC7950"/> data model
   for the management of PCEP speakers. It is important to
   establish a common data model for how PCEP speakers are identified,
   configured, and monitored. The data model includes configuration data
   and state data.</t>

   <t>This document contains a specification of the PCEP YANG module,
   "ietf-pcep" which provides the PCEP <xref target="RFC5440"/> data
   model.</t>

   <t>The PCEP operational state is included in the same tree as the PCEP
    configuration consistent with Network Management Datastore
   Architecture <xref target="RFC8342"/>. 
   The origin of the data is indicated as per the origin metadata 
   annotation.</t>

    <t>This section describes some of the design objectives for the model:
    <list style="symbols">
    <t>In case of existing implementations, it needs to map
      the data model defined in this document to their proprietary
      native data model.  To facilitate such mappings, the data model

    <t>The data model should be suitable for new implementations to use
      as is.</t>
    <t>Mapping to the PCEP MIB Module should be clear.</t>
    <t>The data model should allow for static configurations of peers.</t>
    <t>The data model should include read-only counters in order to
      gather statistics for sent and received PCEP messages,
      received messages with errors, and messages that could not be sent
      due to errors. This could be in a separate model which
      augments the base data model.</t>
    <t>It should be fairly straightforward to augment the base data model
    for advanced PCE features.</t>

    <section title="The Peer Lists" toc="default">
        <t>
          The peer list contains peer(s) that the
          local PCEP entity knows about. A PCEP speaker is identified by its
          IP address.  If there is a PCEP
          speaker in the network that uses multiple IP addresses
          then it looks like multiple distinct peers to the other PCEP
          speakers in the network.
        </t>
        <t>
          Since PCEP sessions
          can be ephemeral, the peer list tracks a peer even when no
          PCEP session currently exists to that peer.  The statistics contained
          are an aggregate of the statistics for all
          successive sessions to that peer.
        </t>
        <t>
          To limit the quantity of information that is stored, an
          implementation MAY choose to discard this information
          if and only if no PCEP session exists to the corresponding peer.
        </t>

   <t>The data model for PCEP peer presented in this document uses a flat
   list of peers.  Each peer in the list is identified by its
   IP address (addr-type, addr).</t>
   <t> There is a list for static peer configuration and operational state of
   all peers (i.e.static as well as discovered)("/pcep/entity/peers"). The list
   is used to enable remote PCE configuration at PCC (or PCE) and has the
   operational state of these peers as well as the remote PCE peer which were
   discovered and PCC peers that have initiated session.</t>

    <section title="The Session Lists" toc="default">
 <t>
          The session list contains PCEP session that the
          PCEP entity (PCE or PCC) is currently participating in.
          The statistics in
          session are semantically different from those in
          peer since the former applies to the current session only,
          whereas the latter is the aggregate for all sessions that have
          existed to that peer.
        </t>
        <t>
          Although <xref target="RFC5440"/> forbids more than one
          active PCEP session between a given pair of PCEP entities
          at any given time, there is a window during session
          establishment where two sessions may exist for a given pair,
          one representing a session initiated by the local PCEP
          entity and the other representing a session initiated by
          the peer.  If either of these sessions reaches active state
          first, then the other is discarded.
        </t>
<t>The data model for PCEP session presented in this document uses a flat
   list of sessions.  Each session in the list is identified by its
   initiator. This index allows two sessions to exist transiently for a

<section title="Stateful PCE's LSP-DB" toc="default">
   <t>In the operational state of PCEP which supports stateful PCE mode, the
   list of LSP state are maintained in LSP-DB. The key is the PLSP-ID and the
   PCC IP address.</t>
   <t>The PCEP data model contains the operational state
    of LSPs (/pcep/entity/lsp-db/lsp/) with PCEP specific
    attributes. The generic TE attributes of the LSP are defined
    in <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te"/>. A reference to LSP
    state in TE model is maintained.</t>

    <section title="The PCE-Initiated LSP" toc="default">
    <t>The TE Model at <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te"/> should
    support creating of tunnels at the controller (PCE) and marking
    them as PCE-Initiated. The LSP-DB in the PCEP Yang (/pcep/entity/lsp-db/lsp/initiation)
    also marks the LSPs which are PCE-initiated.</t>

    </section>
    <section title="Other Considerations" toc="default">
    <section title="PCEP over TLS (PCEPS)" toc="default">
    <t><xref target="RFC8253"/> describe the use of TLS in PCEP. 
    The peer acting as the PCEP client MUST act as the TLS client.
    The TLS client actively opens the TLS connection and the TLS server
    passively listens for the incoming TLS connections.  The well-known
    TCP port number 4189 is used by PCEP servers to listen for TCP
    connections established by PCEP over TLS clients.  The TLS client
    MUST send the TLS ClientHello message to begin the TLS handshake.
    The TLS server MUST send a CertificateRequest in order to request a
    certificate from the TLS client.  Once the TLS handshake has
    finished, the client and the server MAY begin to exchange PCEP
    messages.  Client and server identity verification is done before the
    PCEP open message is sent.  This means that the identity
    verification is completed before the PCEP session is started..</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations" toc="default">
      <t>The YANG modules defined in this document is designed to be accessed via
   network management protocol such as NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/>
   or RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>.  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure
   transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is
   SSH <xref target="RFC6242"/>. The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the
   mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS <xref target="RFC8446"/></t>

        <t>The NETCONF access control model <xref target="RFC8341"/> provides
   the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   pre-configured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.</t>

        <t>There are a number of data nodes defined in the ietf-pcep YANG module which are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g.,  &lt;edit-config&gt;)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations. These are the subtrees and data nodes and 
   their sensitivity/vulnerability:
   <list>
   <t>/pcep/entity/ - configure local parameters, capabilities etc.</t>
   <t>/pcep/entity/peers - configure remote peers to setup PCEP session.</t>
   </list></t>

   <t>Unauthorized access to above list can adversely affect the
   PCEP session between the local entity and the peers.  This may
   lead to inability to compute new paths, stateful operations on 
   the delegated as well as PCE-initiated LSPs.</t>

   <t>Some of the readable data nodes in the ietf-pcep YANG module may be considered 
    sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important 
    to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or notification) to 
    these data nodes. These are the subtrees and data nodes and their 
    sensitivity/vulnerability:

   <list>
    <t>/pcep/lsp-db - All the LSPs in the network. Unauthorized access to
      this could provide the all path and network usage information.</t>
    <t>/pcep/path-keys/ - The Confidential Path Segments (CPS) are hidden
      using path-keys. Unauthorized access to this could leak confidential
      path information.
    </t>
  </list></t>

  <t>Some of the RPC operations in the ietf-pcep YANG module may be considered sensitive 
    or vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important to control
    access to these operations. These are the operations and their 
    sensitivity/vulnerability:
    <list>

  <t>trigger-resync - trigger resynchronization with the PCE. Unauthorized access to 
      this could force a PCEP session into continuous state synchronization. </t>
  </list></t>

  <t>Further, this document also include another YANG module (called ietf-pcep-stats) for maintaining the statistics by augmenting the ietf-pcep YANG module. There are no data nodes defined in this module which are writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true). The readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered 
    sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. The statistics could provide information related to the current usage patterns of the network. It is thus important 
    to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or notification).</t>

<section anchor="Imp" title="Implementation Status">
<t>[Note to the RFC Editor - remove this section before publication, as well as remove the reference to RFC 7942.]</t>
<t>This section records the status of known implementations of the
     protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of
     this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in
     <xref target="RFC7942"/>.  The description of implementations in this section is
     intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in
     progressing drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any
     individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the
     IETF.  Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the
     information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.
     This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a
     catalog of available implementations or their features.  Readers
     are advised to note that other implementations may exist.</t>

     <t>According to <xref target="RFC7942"/>, "this will allow reviewers and working
     groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the
     benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable
     experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented
     protocols more mature.  It is up to the individual working groups
     to use this information as they see fit".</t>

     <t>Currently, there are no known implementations of the YANG Module as specified.</t>
